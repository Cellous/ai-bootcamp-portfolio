A hands-on AI Bootcamp portfolio covering foundations, rule-based agents, LLM-powered agents, and practical AI applications.

This repository contains hands-on exercises, notes, and applied projects completed during an AI Bootcamp program.

## Topics Covered
- Foundations of Artificial Intelligence
- Rule-Based AI Agents
- Smart Agents using Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Agent Design and Practical Applications

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to a specific bootcamp week and includes notes, experiments, and implementation artifacts.

### Week 5 – Agent Execution & Memory

- Implemented Reason → Act → Reflect execution loops
- Built Gradio-based agent UIs
- Added persistent memory and ActionStep logging
- Demonstrated offline-first agent design (no paid APIs)


## Status
Completed up through **Week 5 – Autonomous AI Agents (Execution Loops & Memory)**.  
Includes working agent demos, execution loops, and persistent memory implementations.
