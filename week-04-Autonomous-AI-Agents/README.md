## 🤖 Week 4 — Autonomous AI Agents  
**AI Bootcamp · Agents Track**

### Overview  
This week focuses on **Autonomous AI Agents**—AI systems designed to reason, plan, and act independently across tools and workflows. The goal is to move beyond single-prompt interactions and toward **goal-driven, multi-step agent behavior** suitable for real-world applications.

### Key Concepts Covered
- **Agent Architecture** — reasoning loops, memory, tools, and actions  
- **Autonomy & Planning** — decomposing goals into executable steps  
- **Tool Integration** — APIs, functions, and external systems  
- **Multi-Agent Patterns** — coordinating specialized agents  
- **Error Handling** — iteration, correction, and recovery strategies  

### Practical Takeaways
- Build agents that operate with **minimal human intervention**
- Design **repeatable and auditable agent workflows**
- Apply agent-based thinking to **business automation and analytics**
- Lay groundwork for **scalable AI systems**, not demos

### Alignment with AI Bootcamp Playbooks
This module directly supports the **Business Prompt Playbook Collection**, enabling:
- Autonomous research agents  
- Decision-support agents  
- Workflow automation agents  
- Internal consulting copilots  

These patterns are intended for **freelance consulting, internal automation, and future paid AI products**.
