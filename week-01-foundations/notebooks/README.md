The Jupyter notebooks in this repository were created using **Google Colab** and can be run without installing anything locally.

### Option 1: Run in Google Colab (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the desired notebook (e.g. `week-01-foundations/notebooks/week01_intro.ipynb`)
2. Click the **“Open in Colab”** button at the top of the notebook
3. Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom

This option provides a fully configured Python environment in the browser.

### Option 2: Run Locally (Advanced)

To run the notebooks locally, ensure you have:

- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed

Install required dependencies (example):

```bash
pip install requests langchain openai

Then launch Jupyter:
jupyter notebook

Open the notebook and execute the cells.
