# Week 1 – Foundations of AI in Practice

## Overview
This week introduced the foundational concepts behind artificial intelligence and AI agents, with a focus on how agents perceive their environment, make decisions, and take action. The goal was to understand what an AI agent is and to set up a basic environment for hands-on experimentation.

## Core Concepts

### What Is an AI Agent?
An AI agent is a system that:
- **Senses** information from its environment
- **Thinks** by processing that information and making decisions
- **Acts** based on those decisions to achieve a goal

This sense–think–act loop is the core model behind many AI systems.

### Sense–Think–Act Example
A common example discussed was a robotic vacuum cleaner:
- **Sensing:** Uses sensors to detect dirt and obstacles
- **Thinking:** Decides where to move next based on sensor data
- **Acting:** Moves around the room and cleans the floor

This same pattern applies to software-based AI agents.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python** as the primary programming language
- **Google Colab** for running code in the browser
- **ChatGPT** for interacting with and testing AI behavior
- Introductory exposure to platforms such as **Hugging Face** and **Google Gemini**

---

## Hands-On Work
- Set up a Google Colab notebook
- Verified a basic AI/chatbot environment was functioning
- Ran simple Python code to confirm the development setup

---

## Key Takeaways
- AI agents follow a structured sense–think–act process
- Tools like Colab remove setup barriers and speed up experimentation
- Even simple experiments help validate that an AI environment is working correctly

## Reflection
This week established the foundation for more advanced agent design later in the bootcamp. Understanding the basic agent loop made it easier to see how more complex systems—such as rule-based and LLM-driven agents—are built on the same core principles.
